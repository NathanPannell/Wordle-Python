    ---RULES---
    If char is nowhere in answer, print grey tile
    If char is in the correct spot, print green tile
    If char is in incorrect spot but appears somewhere in the answer, print yellow tile

    ---DUPLICATE CHARACTERS---
    If multiple of the same char are guessed, only return as many green/yellow tiles as there are matching characters in the answer
    Ex.
    guess = 'apple'
    answer = 'poppy'
    print('â¬›ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ©â¬›â¬›')
    both p's can be mapped to different chars in the answer

    two of the p's are given positive feedback, but there is no third in the answer. This means the third p is given a grey tile
